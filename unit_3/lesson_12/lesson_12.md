# Functions
- Identify parts of function declaration
- Write reusable functions to build larger programs

## Declaration 
Consists of 
```
keyword function name (parameter name parameter type) return type
func    Intn          (n              int           ) int 
```

- Functions with upper case first letters are exported functions from their package.
- Function with ellipsis in declaration indicate it is variadic (accepts variable number of args)
